# PR3SI ARCHIVE â€” Netlify Drop

## Deploy (drag & drop)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag this entire folder (or the ZIP) into the drop zone.
3. Done. Netlify will host it at a random URL you can rename later.

## Notes
- This is a static site. Everything runs client-side (localStorage).
- `index.html` is your app.
- `netlify.toml` sets sensible defaults and headers.
- `404.html` is a simple not-found page.
- `favicon.svg` is a basic icon you can swap.
- `site.webmanifest` adds basic PWA metadata (optional).
